#WEB_HOSE#

The web application retrieves character data from a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) via an API and stores it in a MySQL database. Initially, the data from the PLC is in decimal format. Before it gets updated in the database, a trigger converts this decimal data to hexadecimal format.

Once the data is stored in the database, the web application retrieves it and performs a reverse conversion from hexadecimal to ASCII. This allows for the display of the original characters on the web interface.

To enhance the functionality of the web application, additional features could be implemented. For example, real-time monitoring of PLC data, historical data analysis, user authentication for secure access, and alerts for abnormal data patterns. Implementing these features can provide a more comprehensive and efficient system for monitoring and managing PLC data
